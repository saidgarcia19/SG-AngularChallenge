# Frontend Challenge

## Description

For this challenge, you will be creating a basic app for managing your favorite bloggers. You will be able to:

- Add a new blogger with their information
- View a list of your favorite bloggers
- Associate bloggers to each other
- Basic search functionality

## Requirements

Your project should include the following:

- Your project must include a README with instructions:
  - How to install dependencies
  - How to run in development

## Features

Using your preferred technology, please implement the following features:

- As a user, I should be able to create a new blogger with the following information:
  - Name
  - Website
  - Picture url
  - Email
- As a user, I should be able to see all the existing bloggers in a list
  - Name
  - Website
  - Picture
- As a user, I should be able to see a details page of a blogger with the following information
  - Picture
  - Name
  - Website
  - List of friends
  - Email
- As a user, I should be able to search bloggers by name or website
- As a user, I should be able to add a friend to a blogger (blogger has many blogger friends)

The last two features don't need to work with a BE (API,algolig), it can be just a mock. For example, for the search feature you can display an autocomplete list or redirect the user to a results page with mock data.

## Nice to have

Your application can include automated tests.

## Persistance

Data persistance is not required but highly encouraged. Feel free to use local storage, firebase or whatever you feel comfortable.

## Mock data

Whether you persist data or not, you may use this JSON to populate your initial app state.

```js
{
  bloggers: [
    {
      id: "1",
      name: "Juan Perez",
      website: "juanperez.io",
      picture_url: "https://placekitten.com/200/300",
      email: "conact@juanperez.io",
      friends: []
    },
    {
      id: "2",
      name: "Amano Pikamee",
      website: "pikamee.io",
      picture_url: "https://placekitten.com/200/300",
